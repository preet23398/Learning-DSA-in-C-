Implementing a Min Heap (array-based representation):
Write code to create an empty heap.(1 Mark)
Implement insertion operation (inserting an element into the heap).(1.5 for insertion + 1.5 for heapify)
Implement deletion operation (deleting the root element from the heap). (1.5 for deletion + 1.5 for heapify)
Heap Operations:
Implement heapify operation (ensuring the heap property is maintained after insertion or deletion).
Implement extract-min operation (removing and returning the minimum element from the heap). (1 mark) 
Implement heap sort using heap operations. (1 mark) 
Heap Applications:
[ Practice question]Discuss and implement priority queues using heaps. 
[ Practice question] Explore other applications of heaps such as heap-based graph algorithms (Dijkstra’s algorithm, Prim’s algorithm).
Please write a driver(main) function and call all the above functions appropriately from it. (1 mark)
