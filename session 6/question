1. Implementation of Binary Search Tree (BST)
Create a class or data structure to represent a Binary Search Tree.
Define necessary attributes and methods for the BST.

Insertion Operation	
Implement a method to insert a new node into the BST.
Ensure that the property of the BST (left child < parent < right child) is maintained after insertion.

Deletion Operation
Implement a method to delete a node from the BST.
Handle different cases: node with no children, node with one child, and node with two children.
Ensure that the property of the BST is maintained after deletion.

Traversal Operations
Implement methods for different types of tree traversal:
Inorder traversal
Preorder traversal
Postorder traversal

Height Calculation
Implement a method to calculate the height of the BST.
Height of an empty tree is considered -1.
Height of a tree with only one node is considered 0.

Number of Nodes Calculation
Implement a method to count the total number of nodes in the BST.
