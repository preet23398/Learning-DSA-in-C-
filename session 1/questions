Sorting

1. [3 points]Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the kth largest element in the array.
Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

Example:
Input: nums = [3,2,1,5,6,4], k = 2
Output: 5

Test case:
Input: nums = [3,2,3,1,2,4,5,5,6], k = 4
Output: 4

2. [4 points]Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.
You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

Example:
Input: nums = [2,0,1]
Output: [0,1,2]

Test Case:
Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]

3. [3 points]Given an integer array of which both first half and second half are sorted. The task is to merge two sorted halves of array into single sorted array.

Example: 
Input : A[ ] = { 2, 3, 8, -1, 7, 10 }
Output : -1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 10 

Test case
Input : A[ ] = {-4, 6, 9, -1, 3 }
Output : -4, -1, 3, 6, 9
